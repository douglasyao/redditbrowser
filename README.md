```
run this in your terminal
```
python3 google_search.py 'where to get hot cheetos'
```


## scorer `parse_post.py` 
Have `requests` and `beautifulsoup4` installed 

To run, in the command line make sure you're in `redditbrowser`, and find the reddit post that you want to scrape. Then run `python3 parse_post <url>`. You can also just run `python3 parse_post` for the example url I used.
